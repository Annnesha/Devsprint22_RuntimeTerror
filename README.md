Track - Student Community 

Problem Statement: In a huge university like KIIT, organizing and coordinating events can be a massive headache. It can be difficult and extremely tiresome to get a venue, market the event, and ensure you have the right permissions.


So, we want to create a website that helps organizers communicate with the authorities easily and check how many events are clashing and accordingly approve, reject or keep the request as pending. This application will make coordinating venues and planning events for communities exponentially easier.
